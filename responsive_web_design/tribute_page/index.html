        Elon Musk is an inventor and an engineer. He is the owner of, among
        other things, Tesla Motors and SpaceX. Musk is a genius and will go down
        as one of the greatest engineers the world has ever seen. He is pushing
        the boundaries of science and technology with his ambitions in electric
        power and space. Like a true engineer, he has developed solutions for
        the problems of modern civilization. He has plans to solve our traffic
        problems with autonomous cars and tunnel networks. Perhaps more
        remarkable, he has plans to eliminate most of our fossil fuel dependence
        and switch to cleaner and more sustainable sources of energy.
